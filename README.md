####a Game for SE


The game is a project for or lecture "SE". In wich we should learn to use some programms, wich help us to get better
code and implementation and to handle with the written code.



###The Rules:

At first you must dicide if you like to play against the computer or a friend. Then you must choose a fieldsize.
We prefer a size between 15 an 19. You always can place one stone, then it's your opponets turn.
The goal of this game is to get five stones in one row.
Vertikal, horizontal or diagonal, all is possible. Just without an edge.



###Implementation:

this programm is organiced with 3 different layers. We used GitHub for version control,
to get better code sonar, maven and jenkins. Also we implemented some Pattern and Interfaces.
Important was, that we first made our tui run clear, and then set up the Gui.
